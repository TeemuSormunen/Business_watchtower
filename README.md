# Self-evaluations

## Timo H.

I think we achieved our set goals quite excellently, especially if taking into account the meek amount of time we could grain for this project. The favorite-system and the updated navigation menu were particularly successful additions in my opinion.
I mainly worked as a sorts of a lead developer, as well as an extra head for backend coding.
I also handled the bulk of code refactoring into more readable and into more easily expandable form. This became increasingly hard towards the end of the project as more and more features/connections became integrated in their unrefined form.

The team worked well together and were reliable in pursuing their given tasks.

Flutter is an interesting framework and in the future, as the technology yet matures, it could yet become a personal favorite for mobile development.

Self- and team evaluation 5/5.

## Jarko M.

I can say I'm proud that we achieved what we set as our goals, even though other projects took a lot more time than I first thought they would. 
I worked mostly on the backend side and wanted to make the app give better user experience by making it more interactive and give the user
possibility to customize what (s)he sees. I was mostly responsible for the search, save and delete functionalities and they work as intended,
even though there's always room for improvement. Lack of documentation and ever changing 3rd party libraries gave a lot of headaches, but
those situations also taught to just try what works.

Also the team worked very well together everyone concentrating on different areas of app and I have to say that I'm very happy with the result.

Self- and team evaluation 5/5.

## Teemu S.

I'm proud of what we achieved during this project, thanks to our team. My responsible was mainly to implement charts to stock info. 
It took me alot of time to get charts working on our project and even more time to make them look nice because there was not really any documentation, 
i had to look for examples around the web but it was really hard to find examples that helped me.

Team worked nicely together and we helped each other when there was a promplems to solve.

self- and team evaluation 5/5


## Miikka S.

After Mobile application development course we set ourselves 
new features to work on and despite the workload from other 
classes i think we managed to implement those features quite neatly.
Search, favorite- and navigation systems futhers the projects usability.

Thanks to trustworthy team members it was almost pleasurable to shape the
project onwards. Everybody kept their lot and should problem arise it was
solved by collaboration.

There's still much to hone but the project got me interested in Flutter
and checkin' on the project time to time would provide good way to update 
skills and see where Flutter is envolving.

Self- and team evalution 5/5.
